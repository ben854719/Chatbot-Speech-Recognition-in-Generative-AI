Subject: Chatbot in Speech Recognition in Generative AI

Project:

The objective of the project is to develop a chatbot with the use of Google Speech to analyze the information about the Canadian economy in 2025, sourced from the Toronto Dominion Economics website. The demonstration will involve using the chatbot to create a template for answering questions via a speech recognition software called SDK (Software Development Package). The development of AI Assistants is anticipated to become a standard practice across various industries in Canada within a few years.
